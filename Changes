Revision history for Perl extension Net::Evernote::Simple

0.05 (2015/06/27)
    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #105528] Better error message on failing SSL cert
         checks and other http(s) errors

0.04 (2015/06/02)
    (ms) Applied previous HttpClient timeout fix to note store client as
         well. Upped it to 7,500/10,000ms by default.

0.03 (2014/05/07)
    (ms) Upped Thrift HttpClient default timeout from 100/750ms (send/recv)
         to 1000/7500ms to deal with WAN delays (default values set by Thrift
         are suitable for LANs only), erroneously reported as
         "Missing version identifier" by the Evernote API.

0.02 (2012/12/02)
    (ms) Removed generated thrift api code from the manifest, the CPAN 
         indexer didn't like it

0.01 (2012/12/02)
    (ms) Where it all began.
